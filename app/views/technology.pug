          p.lead Nodejs is a powerful backend development framework which allows you to create dynamic page content.  It is an open-source web application framework that facilitates a cross-platform development environment for JavaScript based technologies. Nodejs supports all major operating systems including Windows, Linux, Unix, and Mac OS X. Above all, NodeJS is popular because of its "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm. It enables web application development to be integrated around a single programming language, instead of relying on a different language for writing server-side scripts.
